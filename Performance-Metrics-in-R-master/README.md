# Performance-Metrics-in-R

This is a project that explores various performanace metrics in R. First I created Naive Bayes and K-NN algorithms that predict abalone age from abalone features.
I then compared the algorithms using various performance metrics, and finally I used 10-fold cross validation to re-train the algorithms.
